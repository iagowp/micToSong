micToSong
=========

TL:DR; Receives input from Microphone, and redirects you to a Spotify Song

This little app uses voice recognition to detect what you say, than it looks on Spotify for that song. Spotify will return a list with up to 100 songs, than the app will select the most popular of those songs, and redirect you to the song.

To look at it in action, go to http://iagowp.github.io/micToSong/
